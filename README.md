# About
My solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024), written in Typescript

## Setup
- Yarn
```bash
yarn
yarn build
```
- NPM
```bash
npm i
npm run build
```

## Running the scripts
**Inputs are not included in the repository** - you must add them to the inputs folder for each day (e.g. 01.txt or 12.txt)

- Run all days in order
```bash
node index.js all
```
- Run specific days
```bash
node index.js 1 5 12
```
